<h1>NAO Challenge 2022</h1>

For the NAO Challenge 2022, the NaoNexus team had the honor of collaborating with the Rivela Association to create an interesting and innovative project. The 7 members of the team worked together for months to transform Nao into a real guide capable of navigating through and presenting the works of the exhibition "My Inferno: Dante, poet of hope" and guiding visitors. This project allowed Nao to merge art and science in a unique and novel way, revolutionizing the experience the exhibition had to offer.

In the last week of April, the semifinals of the NAO Challenge 2022 took place, where the team was called upon to host a live presentation with Nao to showcase their project and collaboration with the Association. Here, they stood out from all the other teams.

On May 31st, the NaoNexus team won the final held at the Palazzo Ducale in Genoa. Here, the team programmed Nao alongside students from other teams to create a ballet with the robots from different teams. This activity demonstrated creativity in inventing the choreography and skill in programming multiple Nao robots in a short time to synchronize the ballet. At the end of this performance, the project the team had worked on throughout the year was presented: Nao as a guide to the exhibition "My Inferno: Dante, prophet of hope."

The team, composed of Riccardo Antonelli, Francesco Bernardi, Francesco Albertini, Emanuele Viani, Alberto Rubini, Davide Masini, Elisa D'Iseppi, and Anna Veronesi, was managed by Professor Bellorio.

<h2>Coding</h2>
<h4>NAOController</h4>

The folder [https://github.com/NaoNexus/ChallengeNao22/tree/main/NAOController NAOController] contains the app used to communicate with the NAO through the socket. The interface features 8 buttons representing the artworks present in the room. Upon clicking one of these buttons, a message is sent to the NAO via the socket, prompting the robot to describe the artwork while moving. In addition to selection via buttons, it is also possible to frame the artwork with the camera, which automatically recognizes it and sends the message to the NAO.
