The Ecotide project, developed by the NAONexus team during the NAOChallenge 2023, focuses on goal 14 of the 2030 agenda, concerning the conservation and sustainable use of oceans, seas, and marine resources.

The first task of the app is to provide a real-time water quality index, represented as a map. Specifying the number of vessels in the analyzed context, the application is able to associate each with a pollution level (for example, sailboat = "zero", gasoline-powered boat = "three"), graphically representing their dispersion in the environment. The accuracy of the calculation is then improved by identifying the type of boat, with greater or lesser pollutant factors attributed to different categories of boats (for example, a cruise ship will pollute more than a speedboat). The dataset created allows users to have a better idea of the environment they are interacting with, offering a safer experience in both bathing and other water activities.

The second feature of the app is the reporting of polluted coastal areas. Users can provide the platform with coordinates of an area to be cleaned, which will be directly communicated to local authorities and environmental organizations, enabling them to organize cleanup actions, removing the report once completed. In this way, the app acts as a simple and effective means to identify and monitor polluted areas, promoting active citizen participation in marine environment protection.

The N2N project and the EcoTide application thus allowed the NaoNexus team to win for the second consecutive year, tied with the ISS Galilei team from Mirandola, in the finals of the NAO Challenge. The finals were held in Florence on May 22-23 at the Innovation Center of the Cr Foundation and the Teatro della Pergola.
