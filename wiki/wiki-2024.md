<h1>OneRetail - NAO Challenge 2024</h1>

    <p>NaoNexus is the robotics team from the "Alle Stimate" school in Verona, formed in 2019 with the goal of participating in the NAO Challenge, a prestigious national robotics and computer science competition highlighting the use of the NAO humanoid robot.</p>
    <p>Composed of 10 talented students from the applied sciences high school, the NaoNexus team has dedicated years of hard work to constant improvement. Since its foundation, the group has been led by Professor Giovanni Bellorio, a reference for the students at every stage of the project.</p>
    
    <p>Every year, the NAO Challenge theme changes, but its goal remains the same: to use robotics to solve current problems. In 2024, the NaoNexus team focused on Retail, specifically in-store sales and warehouse management.</p>

<p>For the NaoChallenge 2024, the NaoNexus team focused on the retail sector, both physical and online, with the development of the OneRetail app.</p>

<p>Retail is a titanic undertaking, with numerous management variables and implicit costs often overlooked by retailers, who do not have time to optimize their sales system. Furthermore, some retailers do not have the economic resources necessary to hire in-store experts or to implement effective management systems. Thanks to the collaboration between NaoNexus, Swarovski and MorphCast, OneRetail presents itself as an accessible and complete management solution for all aspects of sales.</p>

<p>Through the use of the NAO robot and the emotional artificial intelligence model developed by MorphCast, OneRetail is able to equip the NAO with emotional intelligence that allows it to recommend relevant products to customers. Furthermore, the data collected by NAO can be used by the retailer to conduct market analyzes and manage inventory and sales.</p>

<p>If you are a customer, thanks to the OneRetail app, you can explore the store's e-commerce from the comfort of your home, or be assisted directly by NAO, who will recommend products based on your personality and emotional reactions.</p>

<p>If you are a retailer, the OneRetail web app offers you a customized management system to control the storage of products both in the store and in the warehouse. Furthermore, thanks to MorphCast, NAO records every interaction with customers, providing useful analytics to understand the correlations between sales and customer preferences. OneRetail is a project accessible to all companies, offering a tool to optimize retail without additional costs.</p>

<p>The OneRetail project manages a database of 42 products, identified in collaboration with Swarovski, monitoring the warehouse availability of each item. This allows you to avoid overstocking and waste, while simultaneously optimizing transport management. This approach, in addition to improving company efficiency, reflects the commitment to sustainability, to which both the company and NaoNexus are strongly oriented. Furthermore, if the quantity of a product falls below a certain level, NAO automatically orders more units, reducing the number of deliveries and contributing to environmental sustainability.</p>

<p>Thanks to OneRetail, the traditional sales system evolves: small businesses can benefit from 24-hour support, while established brands like Swarovski can obtain detailed data on consumer preferences directly from the field.</p>

<p>The team composed of Edoardo Polfranceschi, Alberto Rubini, Arianna Antonelli, Davide Masini, Antonio Galati, Chiara De Marchi, Giacomo Santi, Shenal Fernando, Laura Mascalzoni and Aurora Savoia; it was managed by Prof Bellorio.</p>

    <h2>Project</h2>
    <p>For the NAO Challenge 2024, the NaoNexus team developed the OneRetail app, utilizing the NAO robot and the emotional artificial intelligence of MorphCast. The app provides personalized and accessible retail experiences both online and through direct assistance from NAO.</p>
    <p>OneRetail offers a customized inventory and sales management system for retailers, along with in-depth analysis of customer interactions, all without additional costs.</p>

    <h3>[https://github.com/NaoNexus/ChallengeNao24/tree/main/coding/server Server]</h3>
    <p>The repository in the [https://github.com/NaoNexus/ChallengeNao24/tree/main/coding/server Sever] directory serves as the essential core of the project, offering a range of fundamental functionalities. The codebase is centered around a class called DB, which manages the connection to a PostgreSQL database and provides methods for operations such as retrieving information about customers and items, as well as handling carts and orders. Additionally, there is a CustomFormatter class and a configured logger to colorize log messages based on severity levels. The project also features a script that uses the requests library to send HTTP POST requests to a specific endpoint with predefined data. Introducing Flask into the mix, the project leverages this lightweight web framework for elegant web application development. Finally, two utility functions complete the picture, calculating elapsed time from a timestamp and reading a YAML file. In summary, this repository excels not only in database operations, meticulous log management, and adept HTTP communication but also harnesses Flask for powerful web development capabilities.</p>

</pre>
<p>The decision_tree.py contains the Python code where we coded the dialogue and decision tree and 2 possible dialogues.</p>
<p>This Python code defines a function called recommend_jewelry that provides personalized jewelry recommendations based on customer information such as gender, age, budget, and the desired jewelry category. The function considers various conditions, including different age and budget ranges for specific jewelry categories like bracelets, necklaces, earrings, rings, and watches. The result of the function is a list of recommended jewelry IDs, and the code is structured with nested conditions to handle different scenarios and offer advice tailored to the customer's preferences.</p>
<pre>
if gender == 'male': 
        if age > 60:
            return []
        elif age < 20: 
            if category == 'bracelet':
                if budget >= 155:
                    for item in product_info:
                        if item['gender'] == 'M' and item['age'] < 20 and item['category'] == 'bracelet' and item['prezzo'] >= 155:
                            gioielli_consigliati.append(item['id'])
                    return gioielli_consigliati
</pre>
<p>The code implements an interactive dialogue between the user and a virtual assistant specializing in jewelry. The assistant guides the user in choosing personalized jewelry by asking for information about gender, age, budget, and preferences. Using the 'recommend_jewelry' function, it provides suggestions based on the user profile. During the dialogue, the user can add jewelry to the cart, receive advice on combinations, and complete the purchase. The dialogue ends with a thank-you message from Naonecsus team</p>
<pre>
print("Buongiorno "+nome_utente['nome']+" "+nome_utente['cognome']+", sono peara, il nao del team naonecsus.")

    print("Come posso aiutarti? Anche se sono un robot di gioielli ne so un bel po")
    risposta1 = input()

    <h3>[https://github.com/NaoNexus/ChallengeNao24/tree/main/coding/sequence_diagram Sequence Diagram]</h3>
    <p>This folder contains the flowcharts of the entire project.</p>
<p>The NaoNexus 2024 project orchestrates a seamless shopping experience, uniting physical and online interactions. Customers, represented by CLIENTE, can use a web application (WEB-APP) to access a catalog (CATALOGO) and make product selections. In the physical store, NEGOZIO engages in a dialogue with the NAO robot, which adds chosen products to the shopping cart (CARRELLO). Payment is processed through PAGAMENTO, and a digital receipt is generated. Similarly, in the online scenario, clients access WEB-APP, interact with CATALOGO, and select items added to the online CARRELLO. The payment process is handled by PAGAMENTO, and clients receive purchased products and information online. This integrated approach enhances the shopping journey for NaoNexus in 2024.</p>
<p>The diagram dialog illustrates an online shopping between the customer (CLIENTE) and NAO. Two purchasing scenarios are considered: buying as a gift and personal purchase. Using a decision tree, the assistant suggests compatible jewelry based on the customer's profile. The dialogue involves loops to gather complete information and make product selections. The interaction continues until the customer completes the purchase or decides not to add more items. Subsequently, a courtesy message is sent, and both the customer and the assistant are deactivated, concluding the dialogue. </p>
