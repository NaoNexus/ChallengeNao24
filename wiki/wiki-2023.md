<h1>NaoNexus - Challenge 2023</h1>
<h2>N2N - NAO to Nature</h2>

For the NAO Challenge 2023, the NaoNexus team focused on eco-living, an extremely relevant sector due to climate change, and expanded its objectives through collaboration with Amperia. This is an important Veronese company in the field of energy sustainability with branches throughout Italy, whose mission is to make structures of all kinds more efficient and less polluting by proposing improvements to their electrical systems.

The N2N project, NAO to Nature, has its focal point in the humanoid NAO and branches out into two main sub-projects.

In the first one, with the help of the SolarEdge platform, our friend is able to analyze the input data to offer intelligent solutions aimed at improving the energy efficiency of the considered residence for both residential and commercial buildings. Thanks to SolarEdge's proprietary algorithms, NAO is also able to provide, based on the CO2 emissions saved by the planned system, the number of corresponding trees to be planted to achieve the same goal.

In the second one, after analyzing carbon dioxide levels, air quality, temperature, humidity, and other parameters of a given environment, NAO can communicate them to the user in the form of a dialogue with the robot itself. Based on this data, the humanoid can then autonomously make decisions and suggest solutions to optimize the building's air conditioning system, thus improving the eco-living of the environment itself.

In public buildings, NAO can be used as a management hub for heating profiles in various rooms, an automatic switcher to power on or off certain appliances, and an air quality sensor to propose various air conditioning and air sanitization solutions in harmony with the environment.

The team consisting of Riccardo Antonelli, Francesco Bernardi, Alberto Rubini, Arianna Antonelli, Antonio Galati, Davide Masini, Elisa D'Iseppi, Edoardo Polfranceschi, and Filippo Buso was managed by Prof Bellorio

<h3>Project</h3>

The NaoNexus team committed to creating an innovative project by collaborating with the company Amperia, which uses technologies capable of making infrastructures eco-friendly. The synergy between the team and the company led to the creation of a system that can measure CO2 levels, humidity, temperature, and light through a sensor, which are then sent to NAO. Connected to the environment's home automation, the robot can act on systems such as shutters, lights, and thermostats, ensuring ideal living conditions continuously.

Moreover, NAO can act as an environmental consultant through the use of the Solaredge platform, showing the user changes to make to the infrastructure in order to reduce its environmental impact, such as planting trees or installing solar panels.


<h2>Project folder - coding</h2>

<h4>Folder app_domotica</h4>

The folder [https://github.com/NaoNexus/ChallengeNao23/tree/main/coding/app_domotica app_domotica] contains the code of the domotics app, through which the user can view the humidity, luminosity, CO2 and temperature levels of a specific environment, keeping it constantly controlled. 

<h4>Folder nao_domotica</h4>

The folder [https://github.com/NaoNexus/ChallengeNao23/tree/main/coding/nao_domotica nao_domotica] contains the possible dialogues and behaviors that NAO is required to perform during an interaction with the user in order to regulate the parameters previously mentioned within a room or infrastructure.

<h4>Folder server_domotica</h4>

The folder [https://github.com/NaoNexus/ChallengeNao23/tree/main/coding/server_domotica server_domotica] contains the algorithm that allows the connection to the school's domotics server to make requests regarding actions to be taken, which are based on the values collected through the sensor and then processed by the humanoid.

<h4>Folder nao_solaredge</h4>

The folder [https://github.com/NaoNexus/ChallengeNao23/tree/main/coding/nao_solaredge nao_solaredge] contains the dialogues and actions that NAO elaborates based on the requests of the user who wants to interact with the Solaredge platform, which is used for environmental consultancy.

<h4>Folder server_solaredge</h4>

The folder [https://github.com/NaoNexus/ChallengeNao23/tree/main/coding/server_solaredge server_solaredge] contains the code that allows the connection to the Solaredge platform through which is possible to make several requests, it will then return as a result the possible modifications and installations that can be made to the selected environment.

<h2> Folder Social</h2>

<h4>Folder green_nao</h4>

The folder [https://github.com/NaoNexus/ChallengeNao23/tree/main/social/green_nao green_nao] contains the texts and behaviors that NAO adopts to present the episodes of the GreenNao section. Its aim is to highlight the major eco-sustainable infrastructures and organizations in the Verona territory in a fun and innovative way.

<h4>Folder website</h4>

The folder [https://github.com/NaoNexus/ChallengeNao23/tree/main/social/website/site_main_2023 website] contains the code of the NaoNexus team website, which presents the project and the team in a complete, simple and intuitive way.
