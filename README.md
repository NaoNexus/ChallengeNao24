## NAO Challenge 2023

Every year the theme of the NaoChallenge is changed, however its goal is to use robotics as a means to solve current issues. This edition is based on sustainability and in particular on the points described in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

The NaoNexus team has focused particularly on the themes of clean and accessible energy and acting for the climate.

### Project

The NaoNexus team committed to creating an innovative project by collaborating with the company Amperia, which uses technologies capable of making infrastructures eco-friendly. The synergy between the team and the company led to the creation of a system that can measure CO2 levels, humidity, temperature, and light through a sensor, which are then sent to NAO. Connected to the environment's home automation, the robot can act on systems such as shutters, lights, and thermostats, ensuring ideal living conditions continuously.

Moreover, NAO can act as an environmental consultant through the use of the Solaredge platform, showing the user changes to make to the infrastructure in order to reduce its environmental impact, such as planting trees or installing solar panels.


## Project folder - coding

### Folder app_domotica

The folder [app_domotica](https://github.com/NaoNexus/ChallengeNao23/tree/main/coding/app_domotica) contains the code of the domotics app, through which the user can view the humidity, luminosity, CO2 and temperature levels of a specific environment, keeping it constantly controlled. 

### Folder nao_domotica

The folder [nao_domotica](https://github.com/NaoNexus/ChallengeNao23/tree/main/coding/nao_domotica) contains the possible dialogues and behaviors that NAO is required to perform during an interaction with the user in order to regulate the parameters previously mentioned within a room or infrastructure.

### Folder server_domotica

The folder [server_domotica](https://github.com/NaoNexus/ChallengeNao23/tree/main/coding/server_domotica) contains the algorithm that allows the connection to the school's domotics server to make requests regarding actions to be taken, which are based on the values collected through the sensor and then processed by the humanoid.
### Folder nao_solaredge

The folder [nao_solaredge](https://github.com/NaoNexus/ChallengeNao23/tree/main/coding/nao_solaredge) contains the dialogues and actions that NAO elaborates based on the requests of the user who wants to interact with the Solaredge platform, which is used for environmental consultancy.

### Folder server_solaredge

The folder [server_solaredge](https://github.com/NaoNexus/ChallengeNao23/tree/main/coding/server_solaredge) contains the code that allows the connection to the Solaredge platform through which is possible to make several requests, it will then return as a result the possible modifications and installations that can be made to the selected environment.

## Folder Social

### Folder green_nao

The folder [green_nao](https://github.com/NaoNexus/ChallengeNao23/tree/main/social/green_nao) contains the texts and behaviors that NAO adopts to present the episodes of the GreenNao section. Its aim is to highlight the major eco-sustainable infrastructures and organizations in the Verona territory in a fun and innovative way.

### Folder website

The folder [website](https://github.com/NaoNexus/ChallengeNao23/tree/main/social/website/site_main_2023) contains the code of the NaoNexus team website, which presents the project and the team in a complete, simple and intuitive way.
